    """Builds a Python Wheel.

    Wheels are Python distribution format defined in https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/.

    This macro packages a set of targets into a single wheel.
    It wraps the [py_wheel rule](#py_wheel_rule).

    Currently only pure-python wheels are supported.

    Examples:

    ```python
    # Package some specific py_library targets, without their dependencies
    py_wheel(
        name = "minimal_with_py_library",
        # Package data. We're building "example_minimal_library-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl"
        distribution = "example_minimal_library",
        python_tag = "py3",
        version = "0.0.1",
        deps = [
            "//examples/wheel/lib:module_with_data",
            "//examples/wheel/lib:simple_module",
        ],
    )

    # Use py_package to collect all transitive dependencies of a target,
    # selecting just the files within a specific python package.
    py_package(
        name = "example_pkg",
        # Only include these Python packages.
        packages = ["examples.wheel"],
        deps = [":main"],
    )

    py_wheel(
        name = "minimal_with_py_package",
        # Package data. We're building "example_minimal_package-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl"
        distribution = "example_minimal_package",
        python_tag = "py3",
        version = "0.0.1",
        deps = [":example_pkg"],
    )
    ```

    To publish the wheel to Pypi, the twine package is required.
    rules_python doesn't provide twine itself, see https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/1016
    However you can install it with pip_parse, just like we do in the WORKSPACE file in rules_python.

    Once you've installed twine, you can pass its label to the `twine` attribute of this macro,
    to get a "[name].publish" target.

    Example:

    ```python
    py_wheel(
        name = "my_wheel",
        twine = "@publish_deps_twine//:pkg",
        ...
    )
    ```

    Now you can run a command like the following, which publishes to https://test.pypi.org/

    ```sh
    % TWINE_USERNAME=__token__ TWINE_PASSWORD=pypi-*** \\
        bazel run --stamp --embed_label=1.2.4 -- \\
        //path/to:my_wheel.publish --repository testpypi
    ```

    Args:
        name:  A unique name for this target.
        twine: A label of the external location of the py_library target for twine
        **kwargs: other named parameters passed to the underlying [py_wheel rule](#py_wheel_rule)
    """
    _dist_target = "{}.dist".format(name)
    py_wheel_dist(
        name = _dist_target,
        wheel = name,
        out = kwargs.pop("dist_folder", "{}_dist".format(name)),
        **copy_propagating_kwargs(kwargs)
    )

    _py_wheel(name = name, **kwargs)

    if twine:

        twine_main = twine.replace(":pkg", ":rules_python_wheel_entry_point_twine.py")
